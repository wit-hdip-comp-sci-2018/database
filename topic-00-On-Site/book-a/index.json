The acronym \"SQL\" (sometimes pronounced \"sequel\") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. SQL is used to query, insert, update and modify data in a database.\r\n\r\nMySQL Workbench is a visual database design tool that integrates SQL development, administration, database design, creation and maintenance into a single integrated development environment for the MySQL database system.\r\n\r\nIn this lab, you will install the various components that make up a MySQL database, including the MySQL server and the MySQL Workbench application.\r\n"

Click \"Execute\" on this step, and then \"Next\".\r\n- Now, click on \"Execute\" to run the MySQL installation; then click \"Next\" to continue.\r\n- Click \"Next\" on the Product Configuration and Type and Networking steps.\r\n\r\n- **Important**: Accounts and Roles:\r\n  - In this step, you need to set a password to use when logging into MySQL Workbench. It is crucial that you note and remember this password.\r\n  - Often, we use the password \"root\" as a default password for the root user account. If you want to keep it simple and easy to remember, use \"root\" as your password here.\r\n\r\n![](img/03.png)\r\n\r\n- Click \"Next\" on the Windows Service step, and \"Execute\" on the Server Configuration step; then click \"Finish\".\r\n- The next step installs Samples and Examples. Click \"Next\" again.\r\n- Then you will be prompted for your password, as shown below. Enter the password you set and click \"Check\".\r\n\r\n![](img/04.png)\r\n\r\n- Once it is confirmed that the password is correct, click \"Next\".\r\n- Continue through the next few steps clicking either \"Execute\" or \"Next\", and lastly, click \"Finish\" once the installation is complete.\r\n- MySQL Workbench should launch automatically. In step 4, we will log in to MySQL Workbench.\r\n"

This is the default connection; you can see it uses the default \"root\" user, the localhost server and port 3306.\r\n\r\nClick on the Local instance MySQL56 connection. You will be asked for a password; this is the password that you set during the installation process.\r\n\r\n![](img/06.png)\r\n\r\nAfter entering the correct password, you should see the following view:\r\n\r\n![](img/07.png)\r\n\r\nYou are now logged in to the MySQL Workbench application. In our next lab (the onsite workshop on Friday 15th June) we will create a database and perform some simple queries on the data. \r\n"
