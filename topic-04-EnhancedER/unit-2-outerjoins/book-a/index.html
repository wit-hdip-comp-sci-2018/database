            <h1>Objectives</h1>
<p>In this lab, we will use the Select statement statement to look at multi table and outer Joins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve data from more than two tables.</li>
<li>Perform other types of Join.</li>
</ul>

          <div class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="01">
            <h1>Join</h1>
<p>Sometimes we need to retrieve information from more than two tables. The rule goes that the number of <em>JOINs</em> a Select statement has is 1 less than the number of 
tables involved. So if we have three tables in the query then we have two JOINs, if we have four tables in the query then we would have 3 JOINs and so on.</p>

            <h1>Example One</h1>
<p>For each loan, if we wanted the student&#39;s name who borrowed the book, the ISBN of the book borrowed, and the dates loaned and returned.</p>
<p>There are three things to do here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify which tables have the data you are looking for, student name is in the <em>Student</em> table, ISBN is in the <em>Book</em> and <em>BookCopy</em> tables, loan details are in the <em>Loan</em> table. 
  Since tables Loan and BookCopy can be joined, we will use BookCopy instead of table Book. The tables required are: <em>Student</em>, <em>Loan</em> and <em>BookCopy</em>. 
  Since there are 3 tables, we need 2 joins. </li>
<li>Identify which columns are the primary and foreign keys in these tables. To join the Student and Loan tables, we use the <em>studentId</em> in the <em>Student</em> 
  and <em>studentId</em> in the <em>Loan</em> table. To join the BookCopy and Loan tables we use the <em>copyId</em> in the <em>BookCopy</em> table and <em>copyId</em> in the <em>Loan</em> table. 
  We use these in the <em>ON</em> clause.</li>
<li>Identify which columns we want the query to output; in this case it is <em>fName</em>, <em>lName</em> from the <em>Student</em> table, <em>ISBN</em> from the <em>BookCopy</em> table, 
  <em>dateOut</em> and <em>dateBack</em> from the <em>Loan</em> table. We will use these in our <em>SELECT</em>.</li>

            <h1>Example Two</h1>
<p>The previous example gives us some information about the book loans per student but we still do not know the book title!</p>
<p>We can expand the above example to return the book title instead of the ISBN.
For each loan, we want the student<code>&#39;</code>s name who borrowed the book, the title of the book borrowed, and the dates loaned and returned.</p>
<p>There are three things to do here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify which tables have the data you are looking for, student name is in the <em>Student</em> table, Book Title is in the <em>Book</em> table, 
  loan details are in the <em>Loan</em> table. Since table Book is not related to any of these tables, we also require BookCopy as it has ISBN 
  as a foreign key and BookCopy can be joined with Loan. The tables required are: <em>Student</em>, <em>Book</em>, <em>Loan</em> and <em>BookCopy</em>. 
  Since there are 4 tables, we need 3 joins.</li>
<li>Identify which columns are the primary and foreign keys in these tables. To join the Student and Loan tables, we use the <em>studentId</em> in the <em>Student</em> and 
  <em>studentId</em> in the <em>Loan</em> table. To join the BookCopy and Loan tables we use the <em>copyId</em> in the <em>BookCopy</em> table and <em>copyId</em> in the <em>Loan</em> table. 
  To join the BookCopy and Book tables we use the <em>ISBN</em> in the <em>BookCopy</em> table and <em>ISBN</em> in the <em>Book</em> table.<br>  We use these in the <em>ON</em> clause.</li>
<li>Identify which columns we want the query to output; in this case it is <em>fName</em>, <em>lName</em> from the Student table, <em>title</em> from the Book table,

            <h1>Outer Join</h1>
<p>Please enter the following statement which returns all Student records:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM student;</code></pre>
<p>Now, enter the following statement which returns all Loan records:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * FROM loan;</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the loan data, not all of the students have taken a book loan (as yet).</p>
<p>Now, say we want to produce a query which lists all students and their loan details (if they have any).
The query would be as follows:
`</p>
<pre><code>SELECT concat(fname,&#39; &#39;, lname) as &#39;Name&#39;, copyId      
FROM student JOIN loan           
ON student.studentid = loan.studentid;</code></pre>
<p>This will return the same number of records as the previous statement (SELECT * FROM loan;)</p>
<p>As you can see a JOIN SELECT will only show the student record if it has a loan.
But, how can we return all student records and their loans even if they have NO loan record associated? We must use a <strong>LEFT</strong> or <strong>RIGHT</strong> <strong><em>OUTER JOIN</em></strong>. </p>
<p>An outer join extends the result of a simple join. An outer join returns all rows that satisfy the join condition and also returns some or all of 
those rows from one table for which no rows from the other satisfy the join condition.</p>

            <h1>Left Outer Join</h1>
<p>The <strong>LEFT JOIN</strong> keyword returns all rows from the left (first) table (table1), with the matching rows in the right table (table2). 
The result is NULL in the right side when there is no match.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name=table2.column_name;</code></pre>
<p><img src="img/left.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the previous example written with the <em>LEFT OUTER JOIN</em> syntax:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM student LEFT JOIN loan 
ON student.studentid = loan.studentid;</code></pre>
<p>Execute the statement. Do you see all the null values?</p>
<p>A more realistic SELECT would be:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT concat(fname,&#39; &#39;, lname) as &#39;Name&#39;, copyId 
FROM student LEFT JOIN loan 
ON student.studentid = loan.studentid;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the left table (Student), even if there are no matches in the right table (Loan).</li>
<li>A student name will appear more than once if he/she has borrowed more than one book.</li>

<p>The following example produces for each bookcopy - the copyId, its&#39; book title, the loan details (i.e. the date it was borrowed (if it was borrowed), and the date 
it was returned). This will require joining tables - bookcopy, loan and book.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify which tables have the data you are looking for, copyId is in the <em>BookCopy</em> and <em>Loan</em> tables; title is in the <em>Book</em> table; and loan details 
  are in the <em>Loan</em> table. The tables required are: <em>Book</em>, <em>Loan</em> and <em>BookCopy</em>. Since there are 3 tables, we need 2 joins.
  We need an Outer Join as we want to return all BookCopy records and their loan details whether they have a loan or not.</li>
<li>Identify which columns are the primary and foreign keys in these tables. To join the Book and BookCopy tables, we use the <em>ISBN</em> in the <em>Book</em> and <em>ISBN</em> in the <em>BookCopy</em> table. 
  To join the BookCopy and Loan tables we use the <em>copyId</em> in the <em>BookCopy</em> table and <em>copyId</em> in the <em>Loan</em> table. 
  We use these in the <em>ON</em> clause. 
  We will join the <em>Book</em> and <em>BookCopy</em> tables together with an Equijoin, and then finally left join the <em>Loan</em> table to include all BookCopy details 
  even if there is no match with the Loan table.</li>
<li>Identify which columns we want the query to output; in this case it is <em>copyId</em> from the <em>BookCopy</em> table, <em>title</em> from the <em>Book</em> table, <em>dateOut</em>

<pre><code>SELECT bookcopy.copyId, title, dateOut, dateBack 
FROM book JOIN bookcopy ON book.isbn = bookcopy.isbn 
LEFT JOIN loan 
ON bookcopy.copyId = loan.copyId;</code></pre>
<p>A bookcopy will appear more than once if it is loaned out more than once.</p>
<p>You can write is as follows using the RIGHT join:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT bookcopy.copyId, title, dateOut, dateBack 
FROM loan RIGHT JOIN bookcopy
ON bookcopy.copyId = loan.copyId
JOIN book ON book.isbn = bookcopy.isbn;</code></pre>

            <h1>Example Two</h1>
<p>The following example produces for each Student <code>-</code> the full student name, the title of the books borrowed, the date it was borrowed, 
and the date it was returned even if the student has (or had) no loans.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify which tables have the data you are looking for, student name is in the <em>Student</em> table, Book Title is in the <em>Book</em> table, loan details are 
  in the <em>Loan</em> table. Since table Book is not related to any of these tables, we also require BookCopy as it has ISBN as a foreign key 
  and BookCopy can be joined with <em>Loan</em>. The tables required are: <em>Student</em>, <em>Book</em>, <em>Loan</em> and <em>BookCopy</em>. Since there are 4 tables, we need 3 joins. 
  We need an Outer Join as we want to return all Student records and their loan details whether they have a loan or not.</li>
<li>Identify which columns are the primary and foreign keys in these tables. To join the Student and Loan tables, we use the <em>studentId</em> in the <em>Student</em> 
  and <em>studentId</em> in the <em>Loan</em> table. To join the BookCopy and Loan tables we use the <em>copyId</em> in the <em>BookCopy</em> table and <em>copyId</em> in the <em>Loan</em> table. 
  To join the BookCopy and Book tables we use the <em>ISBN</em> in the <em>BookCopy</em> table and <em>ISBN</em> in the <em>Book</em> table.  We use these in the <em>ON</em> clause. </li>
<li>Identify which columns we want the query to output; in this case it is <em>fName</em>, <em>lName</em> from the <em>Student</em> table, <em>title</em> from the <em>Book</em> table, 
  <em>dateOut</em> and <em>dateBack</em> from the <em>Loan</em> table. We will use these in our <em>SELECT</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we saw previously we need the Book table to obtain the title column, but because it is not linked with the Loan table, we need BookCopy also. 
We can join these three tables together with an Equijoin, and then finally right join the Student table to include all students even if 
there is no match with the Loan table.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT concat(fname,&#39; &#39;, lname) as &#39;Name&#39;, title, dateOut, dateBack
FROM book JOIN bookcopy ON book.isbn=bookcopy.isbn 
JOIN loan ON bookcopy.copyid = loan.copyid 
RIGHT JOIN student 
ON student.studentid = loan.studentid;</code></pre>
<p>Another way of expressing the query (using LEFT join) is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT concat(fname,&#39; &#39;, lname) as &#39;Name&#39;, title, dateOut, dateBack
FROM student LEFT JOIN loan 
ON student.studentid = loan.studentid
LEFT JOIN bookcopy ON bookcopy.copyid = loan.copyid 
LEFT JOIN book ON book.isbn=bookcopy.isbn;</code></pre>
<p>In this example, because we selected from the student table first, we now need to left join it with all the other tables to ensure that all students are included 
as after the first join <code>-</code> loanId and copyId will have null values for students who have no loans AND in order to join these values with other tables we need an Outer
Join.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<ul>
<li>List all the authors by name and the title of the books they have written (even if they have no books at present). Sort in alphabetical order of title and then last name and
then first name.</li>
