The remove method is called with an empty query document {}. The following operation deletes all documents from the bios collection:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ndb.bios.remove( { } )\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis operation is not equivalent to the drop() method.\r\n\r\n\r\n## drop() example\r\n\r\nTo remove all documents from a collection, it may be more efficient to use the drop() method to drop the entire collection, including the indexes, and then recreate the collection and rebuild the indexes.\r\n\r\nThe following operation drops the students collection in the current database.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\ndb.students.drop()\r\n~~~\r\n"

Then, use remove() to delete the first of these documents (hint: you need to set the justOne option).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Further reading\r\n\r\n- Examine the deleteOne() and deleteMany() methods in the MongoDB reference:\r\n\r\n  - <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.deleteOne/\" target=\"_ blank\">db.collection.deleteOne()</a>\r\n  - <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.deleteMany/\" target=\"_ blank\">db.collection.deleteMany()</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n- Use deleteOne() to delete a single document from the grades collection.\r\n- Use deleteMany() to delete multiple documents.\r\n- Use find() after your deletes to confirm that the documents have been removed.\r\n"
